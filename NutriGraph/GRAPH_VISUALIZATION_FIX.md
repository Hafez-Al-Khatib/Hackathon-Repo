# 🎨 Graph Visualization Fixed - Show Symptoms Instead of Just Sentiment

## The Problem

**Before:**
UserLog nodes in the graph visualization showed:
```
Log 1
(positive)
```

You could see the sentiment (positive/negative) but **NOT** what symptom was logged! This made the graph confusing - you'd see yellow "positive" or "negative" nodes without knowing what they represented.

---

## The Fix

### 1. UserLog Node Labels Now Show Symptom Name

**File:** `prototypes/graph_enhanced.py` (line 151)

**Before:**
```python
label=f"Log {self.log_counter}\n({sentiment})"
# Result: "Log 1\n(positive)"
```

**After:**
```python
label=f"{symptom}\n({sentiment})"
# Result: "Nausea\n(negative)"
```

**Now you see:**
```
Nausea
(negative)
```

Much clearer!

### 2. Store Symptom in UserLog Node Data

**Added:** `symptom=symptom` to node attributes (line 150)

This allows:
- Querying UserLog nodes by symptom
- Filtering logs by symptom type
- Better hover information

### 3. Enhanced Hover Information

**File:** `prototypes/graph_enhanced.py` (lines 386-398)

When you hover over nodes, you now see detailed info:

**UserLog nodes:**
```
UserLog: Nausea
Sentiment: negative
Time: 2025-10-04T10:23:00
```

**Symptom nodes:**
```
Symptom: Nausea
```

**Meal nodes:**
```
Meal
Time: 2025-10-04T09:00:00
```

## Visual Comparison

### Before (Confusing)
```
┌─────────┐
│  Log 1  │  ← What is this log about?
│(positive)│  ← Just shows sentiment
└─────────┘
```

### After (Clear!)
```
┌──────────────┐
│ High Energy  │  ← Clear symptom name!
│  (positive)  │  ← Plus sentiment
└──────────────┘
```

---

## Graph Structure (Unchanged)

The underlying graph structure is still:

```
Meal --[LOGGED_NEAR]--> UserLog --[EXPERIENCED]--> Symptom
```

But now:
- **UserLog** shows the symptom name in its label
- **Symptom** node still exists for aggregation
- Both are visible and informative

## Example Visualization

**Scenario:** You ate avocado and felt nauseous

**Before:**
```
[Meal: Avocado] ---> [Log 1 (negative)] ---> [Nausea]
                      ↑ Unclear!
```

**After:**
```
[Meal: Avocado] ---> [Nausea (negative)] ---> [Nausea]
                      ↑ Clear! Shows symptom + sentiment
```

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Immediate Understanding**
- Glance at the graph and see what symptoms were logged
- No need to click or hover to understand UserLog nodes

### 2. **Better Pattern Recognition**
- Spot repeated symptoms visually
- See sentiment at a glance (positive/negative)

### 3. **Clearer Connections**
- See which meals lead to which symptoms
- Understand temporal relationships better

### 4. **Useful Hover Info**
- Detailed information on hover
- Timestamps for debugging
- Sentiment confirmation

---

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Restart Backend

```bash
python backend\main.py
```

(The graph class is imported from `prototypes/graph_enhanced.py`, so backend needs restart)

### 2. Log Some Data

**Upload a meal:**
- Upload avocado image
- Analyze & log

**Log a mood:**
- Type: "feeling nauseous"
- Log mood with AI
- Should extract "Nausea"

### 3. View Graph

Click "🌐 View Knowledge Graph" in sidebar

**What you'll see:**

**UserLog nodes (Yellow):**
```
Nausea
(negative)
```

**Symptom nodes (Light Blue):**
```
Nausea
```

**Clear visual distinction and clear labeling!**

## Node Colors (For Reference)

| Node Type | Color | Hex |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Meal | Red | #ff6b6b |
| Ingredient | Teal | #4ecdc4 |
| Nutrient | Light Green | #95e1d3 |
| UserLog | Yellow | #ffe66d |
| Symptom | Light Blue | #a8dadc |

## Changes Summary

**File:** `prototypes/graph_enhanced.py`

**Line 150-151:** 
- Added `symptom=symptom` to node attributes
- Changed label from `Log X (sentiment)` to `{symptom}\n({sentiment})`

**Lines 386-398:**
- Enhanced hover titles with detailed information
- Different hover content for each node type
- Shows timestamps, sentiment, symptom names

---

## Why Both UserLog AND Symptom Nodes?

**UserLog (Yellow):**
- Represents a specific **event** in time
- Has timestamp, sentiment, and links to meals
- Multiple UserLogs can reference the same symptom
- Allows tracking: "When did I feel nauseous?"

**Symptom (Light Blue):**
- Represents the **concept** of a symptom
- Aggregates all instances of that symptom
- Allows querying: "How often do I feel nauseous?"
- No timestamp - it's a category

**Together:**
```
UserLog_1: Nausea (Oct 1, 9am, negative) ──┐
UserLog_2: Nausea (Oct 3, 2pm, negative) ──┼──> Symptom: Nausea
UserLog_3: Nausea (Oct 5, 5pm, negative) ──┘

Query: "How many times did I feel nauseous?"
Answer: 3 times (counts UserLog nodes)

Query: "What causes nausea?"
Answer: Finds all UserLogs → Finds linked Meals → Gets ingredients
```

## Example Graph After Fix

```
┌─────────────┐
│Meal: Avocado│
│ (9:00 AM)   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ LOGGED_NEAR (1h after)
       ↓
┌──────────────┐       EXPERIENCED      ┌─────────┐
│   Nausea     │────────────────────────>│ Nausea  │
│  (negative)  │                         │(Symptom)│
│  [UserLog]   │                         └─────────┘
└──────────────┘

Clear labels! ✓
Shows symptom! ✓
Shows sentiment! ✓
```

## Backward Compatibility

**Existing graphs:** Will still work but old UserLog nodes will show old labels

**New graphs:** Will use new labeling automatically

**To update old graphs:** Just restart the backend and add new logs - new ones will have improved labels

---

## Status

✅ **Fixed:** UserLog nodes now show symptom names
✅ **Enhanced:** Hover information is more detailed
✅ **Clear:** Graph is much easier to understand at a glance

**Restart backend to see the changes!** 🚀
