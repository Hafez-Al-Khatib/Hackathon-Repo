### Method 2: Manual Start

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```powershell
cd backend
python main.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```powershell
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py
```

### Method 3: Docker

```bash
# Make sure you set your API key
$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Start everything
docker-compose up
```

---

## Access the App

- **Frontend UI**: http://localhost:8501
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000

## Test the Flow

### 1. Upload a Meal
1. Open http://localhost:8501
2. Click "📷 Upload a Meal"
3. Upload `prototypes/images/avocado-salad.jpg`
4. Click "🔍 Analyze & Log Meal"
5. Wait ~3 seconds for AI analysis
6. See ingredients and nutrients displayed

### 2. Log a Feeling
1. Click one of the quick buttons:
   - "⚡ High Energy"
   - "😊 Good Mood"
   - "🤕 Headache"
2. See confirmation in chat history

### 3. Get Insights
1. In the chat section, select "What gives me energy?"
2. Click "🔮 Get Insight"
3. Wait ~2 seconds for AI analysis
4. Read the personalized insight
5. See correlated ingredients

---

## API Endpoints

### Test with curl or browser

**Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

**Upload Meal:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/meal" \
  -F "file=@prototypes/images/avocado-salad.jpg"
```

**Log Symptom:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symptom": "High Energy", "sentiment": "positive"}'
```

**Get Insight:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/insight?symptom=High%20Energy"
```

**Graph Stats:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/graph/stats
```

## Architecture Overview

```
User → Streamlit → FastAPI → Gemini AI
                      ↓
                  NetworkX Graph
```

**Data Flow:**
1. User uploads meal image
2. Frontend sends to `POST /meal`
3. Backend calls Gemini Vision API
4. Backend calls Gemini Text API for nutrients
5. Backend adds data to NetworkX graph
6. Response sent back to frontend
7. Frontend displays results

## What's Working

✅ **POST /meal** - Uploads image, analyzes with AI, adds to graph  
✅ **POST /log** - Logs symptoms with time-based correlation  
✅ **GET /insight** - Queries graph and generates AI insights  
✅ **GET /graph/stats** - Returns current graph statistics  
✅ **Streamlit UI** - Upload, chat, visualize  
✅ **Docker deployment** - Production-ready containers  

---

## Next Steps

### For Demo
1. Prepare sample meal images
2. Create demo script with user story
3. Practice the flow
4. Show the graph visualization

### For Production
1. Add user authentication
2. Use persistent database (Neo4j)
3. Add more sophisticated time windowing
4. Implement meal recommendations
5. Add export functionality

## Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start:**
```powershell
# Check if port 8000 is free
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Check your API key
cat prototypes\.env
```

**Frontend shows "API not running":**
- Make sure backend started first
- Check http://localhost:8000 in browser
- Verify no firewall blocking

**AI responses failing:**
- Verify Google AI API key is valid
- Check you have quota remaining
- Test with `prototypes/pipeline_test.py`

## Demo Script

**"Hi, I'm going to show you NutriGraph, an AI health companion..."**

1. **Upload Meal**
   - "I just had this salad for lunch"
   - Upload avocado-salad.jpg
   - "The AI identifies: avocado, tomatoes, cucumber..."
   - "And tells me the key nutrients: Healthy Fats, Vitamin C..."

2. **Log Feeling**
   - "A few hours later, I'm feeling really energetic"
   - Click "⚡ High Energy"
   - "The system correlates this with my recent meals"

3. **Ask Question**
   - "Now I can ask: What foods give me energy?"
   - Click "Get Insight"
   - "The AI analyzes my meal-symptom graph..."
   - "And discovers: Fresh ingredients like avocado are associated with my high energy days!"

4. **Show Graph Stats**
   - "In just this demo, we've built a knowledge graph with..."
   - Point to sidebar stats

**"That's NutriGraph - your personal health insights, powered by AI."**
